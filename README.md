# Extracting-Stochastic-Governing-Laws-by-Nonlocal-Kramers-Moyal-Formulas

This code for our paper 'Extracting Stochastic Governing Laws by Nonlocal Kramers-Moyal Formulas'. (The authors: Yubin Lu, Yang Li and Jinqiao Duan).

For 1-d case, you can directly run the file 'flow_1d.py' to obtain our results. For 2-d cases, you have to run the 'system_data.m' to obtain the simulated data, 

and then run the file 'flow_2d.py' to obtain the 2-d examples. (Including decoupled system and coupled system).
